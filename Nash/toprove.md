In a repeated Bayesian game with one long-run player and a sequence of short-run observers, there is a public signal of past actions that occasionally becomes available, and the observers hold a positive prior belief that the long-run player might be a cooperative commitment type. In every sequential equilibrium where future partners punish the long-run player after observing incriminating signals, the long-run player’s behavior on the equilibrium path becomes cooperative—provided the player is sufficiently patient. As the discount factor
δ approaches 1 (meaning the long-run player cares almost equally about the future as the present), the long-run player’s payoff converges to the commitment, or Stackelberg, payoff.
