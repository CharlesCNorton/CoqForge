(** * Wedge Sums Preserve Connectivity in HoTT

(** ** Overview
    
    The wedge sum X ∨ Y of two pointed types is their coproduct in the category
    of pointed types. It is constructed by taking the disjoint union and 
    identifying the basepoints.
    
    A type is n-connected if its n-truncation is contractible. This module 
    establishes that if X and Y are n-connected pointed types, then their 
    wedge sum X ∨ Y is also n-connected.
    
    This formalization provides a foundation for more advanced results in 
    synthetic homotopy theory that use wedge constructions.
*)

(** ** Construction of Wedge Sums
    
    We construct the wedge sum as a pushout (a special case of a coequalizer).
    Given pointed types (X, x₀) and (Y, y₀), we form the pushout of the 
    diagram:
    
        unit_name x₀ : Unit → X
        unit_name y₀ : Unit → Y
    
    This identifies x₀ and y₀ in the disjoint union X + Y.

(** ** Elimination Principle for Wedges

(** ** Technical Notes
    
    1. **Truncation levels**: We work with arbitrary truncation indices n,
       not just non-negative integers. This includes (-2)-connected 
       (contractible) and (-1)-connected (inhabited mere propositions).
       
    2. **Computational content**: All proofs are given with Defined rather 
       than Qed, making them transparent for computation.
       
    3. **Universe levels**: The construction is universe polymorphic, though
       we don't explicitly annotate universe levels here.

    4. **Generalization**: This result should generalize to wedges of 
       arbitrary families of types, not just binary wedges, though the 
       coherence becomes more complex.
